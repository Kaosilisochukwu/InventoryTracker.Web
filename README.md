# InventoryTracker.Web
A simple blazor server application for tracking Invntories.
This Inventory Management web appliation is a simple inventory tracking application.
It manages inventories by creating, deleting updating and getting the repositories.

A live application can be found in this url https://inventorytrackerweb.kaosilisochukwu.repl.co/.

There are 4 entities in the project (Inventory, Product, Warehouse and InventoryTransaction).
the basic crud operations can be carried out on all entities except the InventoryTransaction which gives a simple report on the actions that have been carried
on any entry of the inventory.

To get started, if there is no product or Warehouse, they need to be added first.
Then an inventory is created by chosing from an existing warehouse and an existing product.
